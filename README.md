# Number-Guessing-Game
# Overview
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This GitHub repository contains a Java application developed in NetBeans IDE 20. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess the correct number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low, and the game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
